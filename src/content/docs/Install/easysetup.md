Here is a litte guide on how to install the Texture Pack (for you, accustomed users, no it isn't the traditional method).

## Setting Up the Texture Pack

Install our Easy Setup executable [here](https://github.com/Golden-Saiyans/TLHD-Easy-Setup) **(This setup has been made with Inno Setup there are no malwares and the file cannot be verified on Virus Total because it's too large.)**.

**THIS STEP IS VERY IMPORTANT** You will need to set the directory to this `C:\Users\{USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\Citra\load\textures\{GAMEID}\Tomodachi Life HD\`
Depending on your Game Region, the GAMEID will change:

NTSC: `000400000008C300`

PAL: `000400000008C400`

Verify that you uncheck `Create a Start Menu folder` this is unnecessary.

Now, click on `Install`.

When the installation is done, just click on `Finish`.
